<h1>WangEmu Quick Start Guide</h1>

<p>
This is a brief how-to guide in getting up and running quickly
with WangEmu.  There are many configuration options and two major
operating modes; besides, being a faithful emulator, WangEmu is bounded
by the complexity that was inherent in the Wang 2200 system itself.
</p>

<p>The first two sections, of course, are largely irrelevant if this help
is being run from WangEmu's help file itself of course.
</p>

<h2>Unpacking the .dmg file</h2>



<p>
The application and its associated files are distributed in a standard
<tt>.dmg</tt> file called "WangEmu_2.1.dmg".  Place this file anywhere,
for example right on the desktop.  Wherever the file is located, double
click the icon and a virtual disk drive image will appear mounted on the
desktop.  Double click on that image and inside is a folder called
"WangEmu2.1".  Double click on the folder to see the contents.
</p>



<p>
The folders called <tt>disks</tt> and <tt>scripts</tt> contain programs
that can be loaded by the emulator to give you something to play with
right off the bat.
</p>

<h2>Launching WangEmu for the first time</h2>

<p>
The application can be run by double clicking on the executable called
"WangEmu" in the folder that was created when the downloaded file was
unpacked.
</p>

<p>
The first time WangEmu is run, an warning message will appear:
</p>

<p><img src="img/ini_warning.png"  height="146" width="474" alt="placeholder" /></p>

<p>
This is normal and can be ignored.  It is simply indicating that
the file containing the user's preferences couldn't be found.  If
this message appears after the emulator is configured, it is an indication
that something is amiss, such as the file couldn't be saved after the first
run because the user doesn't have write permission.
</p>

<p>
The default configuration is to have
</p>

<ul>
    <li>a 2200T CPU</li>
    <li>a 64x16 CRT at /005</li>
    <li>a keyboard at /001</li>
    <li>a dual disk drive at /310</li>
    <li>a printer at /215</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every time WangEmu exits, all the users preferences are saved in a file
called wangemu.ini.  It is an ASCII text file, but it should not be
directly edited otherwise the configuration might get corrupted; if so,
delete the file and reconfigure the emulator as if it was the first time
the emulator was run.  This file is located in 
<tt>~/Library/Preferences</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Configuring for 2200 VP Mode</h2>

<p>
The default configuration comes up in 2200T mode, which has Wang BASIC
in ROM.  The emulator is ready to run programs.
</p>

<p>
If the user prefers a 2200 VP configuration running Wang BASIC-2, a
few more steps are required.
</p>

<p>
From the <b>Configure</b> menu item, select <b>Configure System...</b>.
There is a choice box in the upper left corner that reads "CPU: 2200T".
Change that to read "CPU: 2200VP".  Click the OK button.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the first generation machines, the VP series didn't have BASIC
in ROM.  Instead, the BASIC-2 microcode had to be loaded from disk.
The same is true for the emulator.
</p>

<ol>
<li>From the Disk menu, select <b>Drive F/310: Insert</b>.  A standard
    dialog box for selecting a file should appear.</li>
<li>Navigate into the "disks" subdirectory of wherever the emulator was installed.</li>
<li>Select the disk <b>vp-boot-2.3.wvd</b>.</li>
<li>Perform a warm reset of the machine, just like a real machine.
    One way to do it is to open the <b>CPU</b> menu and select the
    <b>Warm Reset CPU</b> item.
    <br />You should now see a prompt that reads
    <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KEY SF'?</tt>
    <br />This prompt allows triggering a load of one of a handful of microcode
          images from one of a number of disk drives.
    </li>
<li>For our purpose, we want Special Function key 0, which can be triggered
    by hitting the ESC key.  After a few seconds you should see
    <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loading:&nbsp; VP BASIC-2  Release 2.3</tt>
    <br />then a few seconds later,
    <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; READY&nbsp; (BASIC-2)</tt>
    <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :_</tt>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
You are now ready to run some BASIC-2 programs.
</p>

<h2>Loading a Script</h2>

<p>
At this point you may type some commands or enter an entire program.
WangEmu comes with some program sources to demonstrate some features of
Wang BASIC or to simply allow having some fun.
</p>

<p>
To load a script (which works by reading an ASCII file and having the
emulator pretend the user is a really fast typist), follow these steps.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <b>File</b> menu and select the <b>Script...</b> item.  A
    standard file dialog box will appear.</li>
<li>Navigate to the "scripts" subdirectory of wherever the emulator was installed.</li>
<li>Select a program; for example, chose <b>primes.w22</b>.  Very rapidly
    the screen should fill with the text of the program that was just selected.</li>
<li>When the program is done being read in, type <b>RUN</b> and hit <b>ENTER</b>
    to start running the chosen program.</li>
<li>To halt the program you can reset the machine (from the CPU menu) or you
    can hit the emulated HALT/STEP key.  On the PC this is the Break key;
    on the Mac this is Ctrl+ESC.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You can create your own script files with any text editor that can produce
an ASCII file.  Simply type in the program and use the File/Script...
feature.

                   Wang 2200 emulator release notes, v2.2-pre
				 August 4, 2012
============================================================================


---- What is It? ----

This emulates a Wang 2200 system with a choice of three CPU architectures:

    * 2200B CPU  (first generation 2200, with a somewhat limited command set)
    * 2200T CPU  (the highest end of the first generation 2200's)
    * 2200VP CPU (2nd generation 2200 CPU architecture)

and a number of periperhals:

    * 6312 (64x16) and 7011 (80x24) CRT controllers
    * 6367 keyboard controller
    * either dumb or intelligent disk controller, capable of modeling any
      2270 floppy disk, 2260 hard disk, and 2280 large hard disk subsystems
    * configurable printer controller

The emulator is primarily written under Windows XP, but it should also run
on Vista as well.  Version 2.1 no longer runs on Windows 9x; this is not due
to the emulator code, nor the wxWidgets library.  Rather it is because the
code was compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2008, which refuses
to create a binary that can run on Windows 9x.  If the code is compiled with
a different compiler, the emulator will work under Windows 9x.

Due to the contribution of Paul Heller, the emulator now runs natively on Mac
OS X (10.4.2 at least) as well.  Starting with version 2.1, the OSX version
is distributed as a universal binary.

The emulator very well might run on Linux via Wine, but it hasn't been tested.


---- User-visible Changes ----

*) (M)VP systems can be configured to have 128 KB, 256 KB, or 512 KB,
   in addition to the previously supported 32 KB and 64 KB.  VP OS's
   can't make use of any memory above 64 KB, though.


---- Bugs Fixed in this Release ----

*) The disk controller would assert if it received an unexpected value for
   the first byte of the command sequence.  Because GIO programs can send
   anything at all, the assert was removed and the other values get mapped
   to assume a VP or MVP host if the first byte isn't 0x00.

*) the "Disk/New Disk..." disk factory allowed specifying DS-112, DS-140,
   or DS-224 disk drive types.  These attempted to create disks with 65536
   sectors/track, but this would cause an assertion, as 65535 is the maximum
   sector address which can be specified with a 16b number.

*) attempting to configuring a VP with 16 KB or 48 KB of RAM would trigger
   an assertion.  Now those sizes are disallowed.


---- Minor Tweaks and Implementation Changes ----

*) compiled with the latest wxWidgets library release, 2.9.4

*) fixed a typo in errtable.cpp for error 73;
   it should read "SAVE DCF" instead of "SAVE SCF"


---- Known Bugs ----

*) In the 2200T CPU mode, the real 2200T has a dummy microinstruction
   cycle that performs refresh.  This isn't modelled in the emulator,
   so the emulator is about 3% faster than realtime.

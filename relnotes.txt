---- What is It? ----

This emulates a Wang 2200 system with a choice of five CPU architectures:

    * 2200B     (1st generation 2200, with a somewhat limited command set)
    * 2200T     (the highest end of the 1st generation 2200's)
    * 2200VP    (2nd generation CPU)
    * 2200MVP-C (2nd generation CPU, w/multiple users and 64K word ucode store)
    * MicroVP   (3rd generation CPU, supporting up to 8MB of data RAM)

and a number of peripherals:

    * 6312 (64x16) and 7011 (80x24) CRT controllers
    * 6367 keyboard controller
    * MXD terminal mux, connected to one to four 2236 terminals
    * either dumb or intelligent disk controller, capable of modeling any
      2270 floppy disk, 2260 hard disk, and 2280 large hard disk subsystems
    * configurable printer controller

The emulator is primarily written under Windows 7, but it should also run
under later version of Windows well. This emulator is untested under
Windows XP and probably does not run.

It has also been ported to OSX, though due to compatibility churn on that
platform, it doesn't run on older versions of the OS.

The emulator very well might run on Linux via Wine, as that worked with
older versions of the emulator, but it hasn't been tested for 3.0 at the
time of its release.

---- User-visible Changes ----

*) Previously the wang virtual disk image (.wvd) format supported four
   different disk types, which the emulator uses for modeling disk access
   timing. Those were 5.25" hard sectored floppy, 8" hard sectored floppy,
   2260 hard disk, or 2280 hard disk. Now there are also 5.25" DS/DD and
   5.25" DS/HD types, which were used on some later 2200 models.

---- Bugs Fixed in this Release ----

*) placeholder

---- Minor Tweaks and Implementation Changes ----

*) the about dialog link to wang2200.org now uses the https prefix

---- Tips ----

*) If you are using the OS X version of wangemu and you find that some keys
   repeat when you hold them down (eg, "a") and others don't (eg "b"), it
   is tied to an OS X feature where holding down a key will cause the OS
   to present a pop-up menu with various character accent options. Under
   wangemu, that popup menu does not appear, but it does interfere with key
   autorepeat.

   The emulator sets a per-application preference indicating that it desires
   auto-repeat when a key is held down, but that takes lower priority than
   the global setting for this preference.

   To see if this global preference is set, type:

         defaults read -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled

   If you get a response of "1" then it means this setting has been enabled
   globally. This can be disabled, but it may affect other applications, so
   think carefully before changing it.

   Method 1: (not recommended)

     Disable this feature globally.  Open the Terminal application to get a
     command line prompt, and enter this:

         defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false

     The problem with this is is disables it for all applications, even if
     that applications expressly tries to enable it.

   Method 2: (better)

     Open the Terminal application to get a command line prompt, and enter
     this:

         defaults delete -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled

     By default (I believe) the feature is enabled, so most apps will still get
     the accented character menu on long keypresses, but it allows individual
     applications, such as wangemu, to set an application-specific override to
     disable it.

*) The emulator allows redirecting the printer output to a real, physically
   attached printer. The dialog offers two choices: LPT1 and LPT2.
   Just about no PCs these days support parallel ports. The following
   instructions are now to map a USB port to one of those logical printer
   ports. However, these directions worked on one PC in particular, and
   may need tweaking to get it to work for other systems (or maybe doesn't
   work at all):

   From a command prompt, use the command
       NET USE LPT1: \\JIM-580\HP-920 /PERSISTENT:YES
   to map LPT1 to the named network printer. "JIM-580" is the network name
   of my PC, and "HP-920" is the name of the attached USB printer.
   Obviously change those for your situation.

   However, this doesn't quite work because the emulator will send a
   simple stream of ASCII characters as if it was talking to a dumb printer,
   but the USB printer expects to receive some higher level (HP?) protocol.
   The next part tells the PC to map it to whatever the printer is expecting.

    + Go to "Devices and Printers" control panel.
    + Select the "Add a printer" menu at the top.
    + Specify "Add a local printer"
    + Under "Use an existing port:", select the one corresponding to your USB
      printer ("USB001" in my case); press "Next"
    + It now asks to install the printer driver. Under Manufacturer, pick
      "Generic". Under Printers, pick "Generic / Text Only"; press "Next"
    + Select "use the driver that is currently installed"
      (at least, that is what I did); press "Next"
    + Time to create a printer name. I made mine "USB-ASCII"; press "Next"
    + From a dos prompt, type
        NET USE LPT2: \\<machine_name>\USB-ASCII /PERSISTENT:YES
      It should reply "The command completed successfully".
    + From the Wang 2200 emulator printer windows, select LPT2 as the real
      printer to direct output to.
    + In my case, I had to do "SELECT LIST 015" to get the Wang to put out a
      line feed after each carriage return. The 215 device just ends each line
      with a CR and no LF.
    + If the program ends without filling the last page, you may need to send a
      HEX(0C) (page feed) to the printer to flush out the partial page.

---- Known Bugs ----

*) A real MVP allowed up to three MXD terminal mux cards to be installed
   supporting up to 12 terminals. The emulator allows only one MXD terminal
   because (a) managing four windows is already unwieldy, and (b) for some
   reason the OS hangs if more than one emulated MXD was active and I didn't
   feel like investing the effort to debug it because of issue (a).

*) Because of limitations in the wxSound implementation on OSX, a program
   such as this emits a choppy alert tone instead of continuous one:
      10 PRINT HEX(07):GOTO 10

*) The emulator currently does not model attaching a printer to a serial
   terminal.

*) In 2336 terminal mode, the boundary between character cells when displaying
   graphic characters is noticeable. The fix would require a complete rewrite
   of the display generation code. Maybe this will be fixed the next release.

*) The real 2200 CPUs occasionally insert dummy microinstruction cycles
   to performs memory refresh. This isn't modeled in the emulator,
   so the emulator is about 3% faster than a real 2200.

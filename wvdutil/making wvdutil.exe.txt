These are notes on how to turn the wvdutil python scripts into a windows
executable.

My machine is a 64b windows 10 system, so I strongly suspect the resulting
binary will not work on 32b windows installations.

Step 1: establish python environment
    * installed python 3.9 from python.org website
    * manually added c:\Python39;c:\Python39\Scripts to my %PATH%
    * pip install typing
    * pip install pyinstaller --user  (http://www.pyinstaller.org/)
    * It says to add this to %PATH%
        C:\Users\jb\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python39\Scripts

Step 2: build it
    * mkdir jim\wvdutil
    * copy (various .py to jim\wvdutil)
    * cd C:\jim\wvdutil
    * pyinstaller.exe -F wvdutil.py  (the -F says make single file bundle)
    * executable appears as jim\wvdutil\dist\wvdutil.exe

-----------

I also tried nuitka
    * py -3 -m pip install nuitka
    * py -3 -m nuikta wvdutil.py

This built a .exe, but it requires a python39.dll to be in the same directory.
There is a --onefile option, but under windows at least it isn't that simple,
and I didn't spend the time to figure out the details since pyinstaller worked
fine.

<h1>WangEmu Keyboard Map</h1>

<p>
The Wang 2200 had a number of different keyboard options during
its life.  The earliest ones are best described as being more like
a calculator keyboard that had the letters retrofitted to it than a keyboard
meant for typing.  Later ones did have a more or less normal typewriter
layout augmented with some dedicated keys for performing common tasks.
</p>

<p>
One problem most emulators have is deciding how to map the emulated
keys onto the keys available on the host computer's keyboard.  Many
emulator writers attempt to map the emulated keys to the same positions
of the keyboard even if the key legend is very different (such that a
blindfolded user of the emulated computer would feel at home).  WangEmu takes
the other tack.  As much as possible, if a key with the right legend
is available on the host keyboard, that is the one used to represent the
equivalent 2200 key.
</p>

<p>
That still leaves some problems.  The PC keyboard has many keys
that the 2200 (more correctly, the 2226 keyboard) didn't have, and the
2226 had some keys that the PC keyboard doesn't have.  In these cases,
WangEmu tries to pick keys that are somewhat mnemonic.  Also, not
all keys were directly mapped since such a mapping was rarely used and
adding it to the emulator would cause more confusion than it was worth
(e.g., mapping "RENUMBER" to the shifted comma key, while accuate, would
have necessitated moving the "&lt;" symbol to some other obscure location).
</p>

<p>
Another matter is that there isn't complete standardization on keyboard
layouts.
Perhaps a future version of the emulator will allow for a user-configurable
key map, but for now, changing it requires editing the source code and
recompiling.
</p>

<h2>Special function keys and dedicated keyword keys</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, the Wang has 16 special function keys, while most PC keyboards
have only 12.  Also, Windows has dedicated F10 to selecting the application
menu, for accessibility.  Press it twice in a row to get around that problem.
</p>
<p>
Since F13-F15 don't typically exist, WangEmu has a workaround.
Holding down the control key when pressing F9 to F12 yields the function keys.
Ctrl+F9 through F11 map to special function keys 13 through 15,
while Ctrl+F12 maps to the EDIT key.
</p>

<p>
There are two workarounds available for the lack of a complete set of
F0-F15 keys.
First, WangEmu can be configured to display a toolbar with all the special
function keys.
</p>

<p>
Second, special function keys used in the EDIT mode
are also mapped to control key combinations.
For example, to enter the Wang SF13 key, which in edit mode
causes the cursor to move left one position, it is much more mnemonic to press
LEFT-ARROW (<span class="arrow">&larr;</span>) than the normal mapping,
Ctrl+F9.
</p>

<p>
Below is a complete table of the mappings.  In some cases, there
are two PC keys or key combinations that are used to emulate a given
2226 keystroke.  On the 2200, some of
the special function keys get a dedicated purpose when in edit mode, shown
as the last column of the table. Note that not all Wang keys have an equivalent
PC mapping, including "PRINT" and "CONTINUE".

<p>
Pressing the key or key sequence for SF0-SF15 in combination with the
SHIFT key will generate the codes for the 2200's special function 16 through
31 keys (the 2226 also had only 16 special function keys, SF0-SF15, and
SF16-SF31 were obtained by pressing SHIFT to add 16 to the special function
key number).
</p>

<p>
To recall and edit, say, line 500
either of the following sequences
can be used:
</p>

<p class="code">
500&lt;press ctrl&gt;&lt;F12&gt;&lt;F11&gt;&lt;release ctrl&gt;
</p>

<p class="code">
500&lt;press ctrl&gt;&lt;E&gt;&lt;F&gt;&lt;release ctrl&gt;
</p>

<h2>Keyword Keys</h2>

<p>
The 2226 keyboard had two modes of operation: "Keyword/A" and "A/a".
Which mode the keyboard was in was controlled by a toggle switch on the
left side of the keyboard.  This is controlled in the emulator in any of
three ways: the checkbox in the lower left corner of the emulated CRT window,
via the Configure/Keyword mode menu item, or with the
Alt+K shortcut.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
    <td><img src="img/keyword1.png"  height="33" width="143" alt="placeholder" /></td>
    <td></td>
    <td><img src="img/keyword2.png"  height="33" width="143" alt="placeholder" /></td>
    <td></td>
    <td><img src="img/menu_config.png"  height="108" width="194" alt="placeholder" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
In "A/a" mode, the keyboard works pretty
much like a typewriter, with unshifted keys producing lower case letters
and shifted keys producing capital letters.  In "Keyword/A" mode,
unshifted keys produced capital letters while shifted keys produced BASIC
keywords.  Most of them have been preserved.

<p>
A few keys that couldn't be conveniently mapped to their Wang-like positions,
but which are exceedingly useful, have been mapped to control keys:
</p>

<table class="keywords">
<thead>
<tr>
    <td>PC key</td>
    <td>Keyword</td>
</tr>
</thead>

<tr>
    <td>Ctrl+Z</td>
    <td>CONTINUE</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Ctrl+L</td>
    <td>LIST</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Ctrl+P</td>
    <td>PRINT</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Ctrl+R</td>
    <td>RUN</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
It should be noted that the GUI itself has these keyboard accelerators:
</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
    <td>PC key</td>
    <td>Function</td>

</thead>

<tr>
    <td>Alt+G</td>
    <td>screen grab</td>

    <td>Alt+X</td>
    <td>exit application</td>

    <td>cold reset</td>

    <td>Alt+W</td>
    <td>warm reset</td>

    <td>Alt+K</td>
    <td>toggle keyword mode</td>

<tr>
    <td>Alt+Enter</td>
    <td>toggle fullscreen mode</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
Finally, here is a diagram showing where all the keys are mapped,
at least on my keyboard.  Certain keys may appear in different locations
on different keyboards, especially European keyboards.

<h2><a name="File">File menu:</a>[% img("printer_menu_file.png") %]</h2>

<p>
The File menu is kind of a catch-all. The three menu items are:
</p>

<table class="menu_table">
<tr>
    <td>Close</td>
    <td>This menu item closes the printer window of course. Less obvious
    is that when the printer window is closed it still retains its text contents
    and still accumulates characters that get printed. Closing it really
    just hides the window from view. Pressing [% os_pick("Ctrl-W","Cmd-W") %]
    in the application is shortcut to invoke this function.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Save As</td>
    <td>Save As allows saving the printer text log to a file on the system
    disk. Pressing [% os_pick("Ctrl-S","Cmd-S") %] in the application is
    shortcut to invoke this function.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Clear Printer</td>
    <td>Clear Printer causes the print log to be cleared, which is immediate
    reflected in the printer window. There is no way to undo the clear.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Print Preview</td>
    <td>This invokes the standard system print preview dialog to allow printing
        part or all of the contents of the printer log file to a system printer.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Print</td>
    <td>This invokes the standard system print dialog to allow printing part
    or all of the contents of the printer log file to a system printer.
    Pressing [% os_pick("Ctrl-P","Cmd-P") %] in the application is shortcut to invoke this
    function.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="Display">Display menu:</a>[% img("printer_menu_display.png") %]</h2>

<table class="menu_table">

<tr>
    <td>Font Size</td>
    <td>These section of the menu is used to affect the size of the text as
        it is shown in the window. It doesn't affect the size of the text
        when it is actually printed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Greenbar</td>
    <td>The "Greenbar" item is a toggle that affects whether the text is
        printed on greenbar paper. Here is a small part of a window showing
        the effect:
    <p>Plain:</p>
    <p>[% img("printer_plain.png") %]</p>
    <p>Greenbar:</p>
    <p>[% img("printer_greenbar.png") %]</p>
    </td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="Configure">Configuration menu:</a>
    [% img("printer_menu_configure.png") %]</h2>

<table class="menu_table">
<tr>
    <td>Emulated printer setup</td>
    <td>This brings up a dialog that allows specifying some configuration
        details about the printer window behavior.

        <p>[% img("printer_configuration.png") %]</p>

        <p>
        The page length and line length should be fairly obvious. The page
        breaks are shown in the printer window as a horizontal dashed gray
        line, somewhat like perforation marks. For whatever line length is
        chosen, remember that BASIC must be told this too via the select
        statement, e.g.
        </p>

        <p class="code">SELECT LIST 215(80)</p>

        <p>
        to indicate that the listing should appear on the printer at address
        215 with 80 columns of text.
        </p>

        <p>
        "Auto show printer view," when checked, indicates that if the printer
        window is hidden and new text arrives from the application, the printer
        window should automatically be opened.
        </p>

        <p>
        "Auto print full pages," when checked, indicates that any time another
        complete page of text has accumulated, automatically print that page
        on the system printer.
        </p>

        [% IF (os == "pc") %]
        <p>If "Print directly to port" is checked, the LPT1/LPT2 section
        specifies which parallel port to send the printer byte stream to.
        This allows connecting a real Centronics (parallel port) printer.
        Be warned, though, that if the printer is not connected, the emulator
        may hang and need to be killed. The emulator does no checking to
        make sure there really is a printer connected before it starts sending
        data.
        </p>
        [% END -%]

<tr>
    <td>Real printer setup</td>
    <td>This invokes that standard system printer setup dialog.</td>
